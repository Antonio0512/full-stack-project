## Backend

The backend of the Music Library app is built using Python and Django. It provides the server-side functionality and handles the storage, retrieval, and processing of data.

### Technologies Used

- Python: The backend is written in Python, a powerful and versatile programming language.
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for rapid development and clean, maintainable code.
- PostgreSQL: The backend uses a PostgreSQL database to store and manage the app's data.
- Django REST Framework: An extension for Django that simplifies the creation of APIs and enables seamless integration with the frontend.

### Backend Structure

The backend follows a typical Django project structure, with the following main components:

- Models: The models define the database structure and define how the data is organized and stored.
- Views: The views handle requests from the frontend, perform necessary operations, and return responses.
- Serializers: Serializers convert model instances into JSON representation and vice versa, enabling smooth communication with the frontend.
- URLs: The URL configuration maps incoming requests to specific views.
- Authentication and Authorization: The backend includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user-specific data and actions.

### API Endpoints

The backend exposes a RESTful API that the frontend interacts with. Here are some of the main API endpoints:

- `/api/songs`: Handles operations related to songs, such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting songs.
- `/api/albums`: Deals with album-related operations, including retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting albums.
- `/api/comments`: Manages comments on songs, allowing users to retrieve, create, update, and delete comments.
- `/api/users`: Provides endpoints for user-related actions, such as user registration, login, profile updates, and deletion.

### Interaction with Frontend

The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP requests and receives JSON responses. It makes API calls to retrieve song and album data, submit comments, and perform user-specific actions like liking or disliking songs.

The backend processes these requests, interacts with the database, and returns the necessary data or appropriate status codes.
